                    <p class="section-text">
                        MindMaze is an interactive experience designed to challenge your perceptions about artificial intelligence 
                        and human creativity. Through a series of carefully crafted text samples, we explore the increasingly 
                        blurred line between AI-generated and human-written content.

                    <p class="section-text">
                        In an age where AI can write poetry, craft stories, and express emotions, we're forced to ask: 
                        What makes something authentically human? Is it the content itself, or our perception of it?
                    </p>
                    <p class="section-text">
                        MindMaze isn't just a quiz‚Äîit's a thought experiment. By presenting you with text samples that 
                        challenge your intuition, we invite you to question your own assumptions about creativity, 
                        authenticity, and the nature of intelligence itself.

                    <p class="section-text">
                        Unlike traditional AI detection tools, MindMaze focuses on the <em>human experience</em> of 
                        encountering AI-generated content. We're not testing your technical knowledge‚Äîwe're exploring 
                        your intuition, pattern recognition, and the cognitive biases that shape how we perceive authenticity.
                    </p>
                    <p class="section-text">
                        The game features a carefully designed twist ending that challenges the very premise of 
                        "detecting" AI, inviting players to think more deeply about what authenticity means in 
                        the age of large language models.

                        To foster thoughtful conversation about AI's role in creative expression and help people

                        the future isn't about humans versus AI, but about understanding how these technologies 
                        shape our perception of creativity and authenticity.
